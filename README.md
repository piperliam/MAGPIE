Atmospheric & Ground Probe
Instrumentation Experiment (MAGPIE)

The Mars Atmospheric and Ground Probe Instrumentation Experiment, MAGPIE, is a multi-lander mission intended to create the first time-synchronous, planet-wide record of surface meteorology and atmospheric electricity on Mars while demonstrating a low-cost, modular architecture that can be scaled to future science networks or crew-support infrastructures. The project consists of a single carrier-relay spacecraft called the MAGPIE Orbiter and six identical surface probes. The MAGPIE Orbiter constitutes the sole flight element during every phase from launch through cruise, Mars orbital insertion, surface probe deployment, and science relay. Its critical subsystems include a primary three-axis reaction-wheel assembly sized for fine attitude control, a smaller redundant three-axis wheel set that can assume control in the event of saturation due to degradation, body-mounted solar-array wings delivering 1.6 kilowatts of power at Mars perihelion, a dual redundant UHF and LoRa relay package for in-situ links, and a 200 watt RF X-band high-gain system interfacing with 70-meter Deep Space Network stations for Earth communications. Radiation-hardened avionics, autonomous fault management, and closed-loop momentum dumping using hydrazine thrusters provide sufficient robustness for a two-year primary mission.
MAGPIE is scheduled for launch in late November 2028 aboard a Falcon 9 Heavy rocket. After insertion into an initial low Earth parking orbit at 350 kilometers altitude and a 28.5-degree inclination, the Falcon’s second stage performs a direct injection burn, imparting approximately 2.8 kilometers per second of delta-V. This places the MAGPIE Orbiter on an Earth-Mars transfer trajectory requiring only a modest trim maneuver of 848 meters per second to achieve the desired Lambert transfer, departing Earth with a hyperbolic excess velocity (v∞) of 3.191 kilometers per second. Throughout the cruise phase, precise navigation is maintained via star-tracker & GNC updates and periodic 50-newton course-correction burns, ensuring arrival accuracy within 500 kilometers (one-sigma) at Mars’s sphere of influence.
To optimize propellant usage and correct inclination discrepancies from Earth departure, the mission employs a bi-elliptic capture strategy at Mars. This involves executing a sequence of carefully planned finite-thrust maneuvers using two MOOG Inc.’s MONARC-445 engines (each delivering 445 newtons of thrust). On August 2nd, 2029, the orbiter initiates the first burn, applying 0.541 kilometers per second of delta-V to raise its apoapsis. This is followed by a three-part plane-change maneuver at apoapsis totaling 1.805 kilometers per second, adjusting the orbital inclination to 75 degrees. The sequence concludes with a final 0.859 kilometers per second burn to circularize the orbit. By August 28th, 2029, the spacecraft achieves a stable 300-kilometer circular science orbit around Mars, having expended a total Mars insertion delta-V of 3.205 kilometers per second, retaining a comfortable propellant margin of 0.295 kilometers per second. This orbit configuration guarantees consistent daily ten-minute communication windows for each designated landing site.

The six probes, each 19.5 kilograms wet mass, occupy radial slots in a cylindrical bay at the core of the MAGPIE Orbiter. Release is timed one probe per orbit when relative position guarantees a clear descent corridor. Each probe is an autonomous aeroshell that integrates an offset-mass impregnated carbon ablator heat shield, with a passive lift bias, a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute, and a throttleable monopropellant retrorocket cluster with a wet mass of 47 kilograms. Entry interface occurs at an altitude of 125 kilometers, an inertial velocity of 6 kilometers per second, and a flight path angle of -10 degrees. A six degree of freedom simulation encoded in Python and validated against Mars Science Laboratory flight data. The model handles the coupled translational and rotational dynamics. It ultizlies the Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model density, angle of attack dependent aerodynamic coefficients, variable ablation thickness, and convective plus radiative heating. Establishing an abort criterion of 2500 kelvin, the analysis predicts a peak stagnation temperature of roughly 1653 kelvin and a final capsule temperature of 1020 kelvin with half a kilogram of ablator remaining. Parachute inflation begins at Mach 1.9 and completes within four seconds. At 1500 meters altitude the heat shield back shell is jettisoned, the vehicle reorients, and the retrorocket fires for ten seconds at 450 Newtons, delivering a net vertical velocity of negative 71 meters per second at impact. Horizontal velocity is limited to 4 meters per second, and the mechanical shock on landing peaks at 36g, secondary to retrorocket plume soil entrainment. Conservative soil strength assumptions imply a transient crater diameter of 3.6 meters for any unburned descent energy, within acceptable mission constraints.
The six MAGPIE surface probes are strategically deployed to span a wide range of Martian latitudes, enabling simultaneous environmental sampling across key climatological and geological



zones. Landing sites are chosen to maximize scientific return while ensuring safe descent and consistent communication windows with the orbiter.
1. MAGPIE-1 is targeted near the northern flank of Olympus Mons, offering insight into high- altitude atmospheric flows, orographic cloud formation, and the influence of topography on convective activity.
2. MAGPIE-2 is assigned to Hellas Planitia, the deepest known impact basin on Mars. Its low elevation presents an opportunity to study high-pressure boundary layer behavior and enhanced dust loading in a basin environment.
3. MAGPIE-3 will land in Planum Boreum, the north polar region, during the late summer season to observe CO2 frost sublimation and polar cap retreat dynamics.
4. MAGPIE-4 is deployed to Planum Australe, the south polar counterpart, providing a mirror dataset to MAGPIE-3 for hemispheric comparison of volatile cycles and cold-season meteorology.
5. MAGPIE-5 and MAGPIE-6 are reserved for sites selected along the equator-crossing orbital track, focusing on regions of future human landing interest or serving as flexible backups. These locations ensure operational diversity and provide redundancy in the event of entry anomalies at other sites.
This site configuration enables the MAGPIE network to span from +90° to –90° latitude,
capturing the vertical and horizontal structure of Martian near-surface processes with temporal coherence. Each probe release is timed to its orbital pass to ensure accurate targeting and clear descent trajectories. The final science orbit geometry ensures no fewer than one ten-minute line-of-sight communication window per site per orbit, allowing reliable daily data return throughout the mission.

Once safely landed, each MAGPIE probe begins its primary science phase lasting 14 Martian sols. The probes carry a comprehensive suite of instruments designed to capture detailed atmospheric and environmental data. The primary sensor payload includes pressure, temperature, and humidity transducers, embedded carbon dioxide sensors oriented downward and outward from the probe, a solid- state thermal anemometer with a ±40 meters-per-second measurement range, and a wideband electric field antenna coupled with a preamplifier and filtering circuitry specifically designed to detect lightning activity. Additionally, each probe houses a digital microphone integrated with analog front-end electronics, capable of recording acoustic frequencies from 20 hertz to 12 kilohertz.
Supporting navigation and post-landing analyses, each probe is equipped with Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) sensors, comprising a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU), radar altimeter, tri-axis magnetometer, and two descent-phase cameras, each capturing imagery at one megapixel resolution. These sensors continue recording limited housekeeping and diagnostic data after landing, providing critical ground-truthing information.
Electrical power is delivered through a regulated 12-volt bus, sourced from four nickel-metal hydroxide battery cells totaling 86 watt-hours. Batteries are trickle-charged by cone-mounted photovoltaic panels, generating approximately 63 watt-hours per sol at equatorial locations and around 52 watt-hours per sol at mid-latitudes. Thermal and power modeling indicates that sustained polar darkness during the Martian winter will require the high-latitude probes to enter a low-power survival mode once their battery state-of-charge drops below 5%. In this mode, only critical pressure and temperature sensors remain active, powered by an 18 watt-hour lithium iron disulfide emergency battery. Simulations confirm the emergency battery will be activated at latitudes of +90°, +45° and 0°. The probe at -90° latitude is expected to fully exhaust its power reserves and cease operation after the first polar night. Conversely, the probe at 45° latitude will successfully exit survival mode when sufficient sunlight returns, recharging its primary batteries. All other probe sites maintain a positive energy balance throughout the entire mission duration.

You can also see a spike in power for the first time the probe dips below 10% SoC where the emergency battery is activated. Made using Python.
MAGPIE employs a communication architecture optimized for simplicity, reliability, and energy efficiency. Each surface probe is equipped with two complementary communication systems: a
primary 3-watt narrowband UHF transmitter operating at 433 megahertz, and a secondary 1-watt LoRa transceiver operating at 915 megahertz. Probe antennas utilize omnidirectional patch designs with approximately 3 dB of gain, ensuring consistent communication regardless of probe orientation.
In orbit, the MAGPIE Orbiter maintains continuous communication capabilities using a fixed 6 dB gain log-periodic array antenna, oriented to maintain its boresight within ± 40° of nadir. The slew time for the orbiter is 50% faster than any mission need. Comprehensive link budget analyses incorporate system losses such as a 200 kelvin noise temperature and a 0.6 dB implementation loss, yielding robust uplink margins of approximately 15 dB for UHF and 14 dB for LoRa at the worst-case slant range of 1325 kilometers. To further enhance efficiency, the LoRa system utilizes an adaptive data rate, dynamically adjusting from 1.2 kilobits per second at low elevation angles (below 30°), to 5.5 kilobits per second between 30-60° elevation, and reaching 10.4 kilobits per second above 60° elevation. Consequently, a typical ten-minute orbital pass permits the downlink of roughly 1.5 megabytes of compressed meteorological and housekeeping data with an average RF transmit power of only 1.6 watts. The MAGPIE Orbiter subsequently relays all surface probe data back to Earth once each orbit utilizing its high-powered, 200-watt X-band traveling wave tube amplifier coupled with a 1.5-meter high-gain antenna dish. Link performance analysis with NASA’s 70-meter Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas indicates a reliable energy-per-bit-to-noise-density margin of approximately 2 dB, maintaining robust communication even during peak Earth-Mars conjunction distances of up to 3.7 astronomical units. This ensures consistent, high-quality data return throughout the mission duration.
MAGPIE’s scientific objectives align directly with priority goals identified by NASA’s Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) and the European Space Agency’s exploration roadmap. By simultaneously capturing atmospheric data across six distinct Martian latitudes— including pressure tides, temperature profiles, wind vectors, and dust electrification—the mission provides critical constraints on regional boundary-layer circulation, dust devil dynamics, and diurnal energy balances unachievable with single-site rovers. Observations of lightning will quantify electrostatic charge separation in dust storms, illuminating its role in atmospheric escape processes through ion generation. The inclusion of acoustic sensors further enriches the scientific yield, capturing ambient wind turbulence, rockfall events, and micro-quakes, thus greatly expanding the Martian acoustic record initiated by the Perseverance rover.
At polar locations, the probes will track seasonal sublimation rates of carbon dioxide and water frost, enhancing volatile transport models that inform future resource-utilization strategies. Moreover, descent imagery and inertial measurements obtained during landing provide valuable vertical density and temperature profiles, enabling cross-validation with existing orbital radio occultation datasets.

Though minimal enough not to impair communication reliability, this measurable effect offers an additional method for deriving temperature, humidity, and pressure profiles within Mars’s upper atmosphere. Made using Python.
Beyond its immediate scientific goals, MAGPIE demonstrates several key technologies enabling future planetary exploration missions. The lift-biased aeroshell design achieves a three-fold increase in landing site targeting range compared to traditional ballistic entry methods, while utilizing cost-effective commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) materials. The adaptive LoRa communication protocol confirms the viability of low-power, low-bit-rate surface-to-orbiter communications at interplanetary distances. Additionally, the battery-centric power architecture, supported by emergency backup packs, demonstrates that sustained surface operations are feasible without reliance on radioisotope power units. The incorporation of redundant reaction wheel systems aboard the orbiter further exemplifies robust fault tolerance without excessive hydrazine propellant usage. Insights gained through MAGPIE will directly influence the development of advanced weather monitoring networks, rover-support communication relays, and distributed geophysical science platforms.
In summary, MAGPIE integrates an efficient Earth-Mars transfer strategy, robust orbiter-based deployment mechanisms, a sophisticated six-degree-of-freedom entry, descent, and landing system, and adaptive communication technologies to achieve unprecedented multi-site meteorological coverage on Mars. Extensive subsystem modeling and rigorous testing demonstrate a high probability of successful landings and sustained multi-sol operations across all sites. By addressing critical knowledge gaps in Martian boundary-layer physics and validating scalable technological solutions, MAGPIE significantly advances preparations for safe human exploration and supports sustained robotic missions to Mars within the coming decade.
